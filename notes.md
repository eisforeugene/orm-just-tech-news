why didn't we install mysql? sequelize prefers to work with mysql2 library

sequelize: promise-based node.js ORM. It is a JavaScript library that works with any dialect of SQL. Saves time writing SQL to define our tables and queries because we can use object oriented concepts to model our database tables using JavaScript classes -- validators custom rules. Entirely JavaScript library that allows the developer to write JS that interacts with a relational DB

object relational mapping: is a technique that allows us to query and manipulate data that is stored in a relational db without writing sql queries
- use object-oriented approach by taking advantage of methods provided by the ORM
Advantages: easy to test, support for syncing db, validates data and can restrict to specifc form, complex sql queries can be used using relatively simple JS syntax

schema: represents any structure that we're defining around the data: tables, views, fields, packages, etc
